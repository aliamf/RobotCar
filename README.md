**My design of figth robot car base consist of:**
 -plate which is the base where all parts are assembled. the plate can be made of many materials as wood, PLA, and aluminum. aluminum is suggested due to lighter weight and higher durability.
 
 -table that hold the controller, drivers, and other electronic components. the batteries can be installed bellow the table. as the table it can be made from the same materials but PLA is preferred due to low weight and accepting self thread screws as wood screws. 
 
 -the table and plate have slots for cables. 
 
 -balloon holder.
 
-screws holes, motor brackets, plate and table thickness and other minor dimensions will be modified depending on the motor types and other of the shelf components.

-arduino mega 3d printable case added to the assembly as reference.
for wheels, I have choose mecanum wheel due to the higher diversity of motion direction.

-Morphological analysis is added in image.png

-3D printable case for the car to hide cables abd electronics can be desighned after choosing the parts.

note: the wheels needs to be installed in the exact orientaion showened in the assembly
